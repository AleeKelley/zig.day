Zig Day is not the only "meetup" with a full day, collaborative, in person format, and you don't need permission from us (or anybody else) to start your own event of this kind.

What makes a full day, collaborative, in person programming event a Zig Day is the focus on two main topics: **applied systems thinking** and **focusing on creating Software You Can Love**, as understood by the Zig community.

If you have been in the Zig community for long enough to appreciate these two cultural values, then ping Loris at `loris@zig.day` to start the process.
