Zig Day is not the only "meetup" with a collaborative in-person programming format, and you don't need permission from us (or anybody else) to start your own event of this kind.

What makes a collaborative in-person programming event a Zig Day is the focus on two main topics: **applied systems thinking** and **focusing on creating Software You Can Love**, as understood by the Zig community.

If you have been in the Zig community for long enough to appreciate these two cultural values, then ping Loris at `loris@zig.day` to start the process.


Here are some quick FAQs about how this works.


## Who will own the new Zig Day? Is there any money involved?

The ownership of the event is entirely yours, and of any co-organizer you might have.

No money will exchange hands and if some day you decide to rebrand your event
to something else, that's entirely up to you.


## What are the requirements for branding an event Zig Day?
For as long as your event brands itself as a Zig Day, you are
expected to uphold the format guidelines, specifically when it comes to:

1. The event must be primarily about collaborative in-person programming.
2. The event must put emphasis on systems thinking and software you can love
   (high quality, non user-hostile software, as a first approximation).

See [Event Format Guidelines](/about/).

If your event is a normal meetup where people listen to one or two talks and
then go to a pub, that's not Zig Day. If your event is some kind of venture
capital pitch building orgy, that's not a Zig Day.

That said, within these limits you will still have a huge amount of flexibility
to accommodate for your logistical situation and your own personal interests
and preferences.

For example even though it's cool to spend a full day doing collaborative
programming, if you can only organize a half-day event, that's still fine.

As another example, if you have a specific topic or theme that you want to weave
into the event, you are welcome to do so (e.g. focus on gamedev or a 'ladies'
Zig Day), as long as it's not in conflict with the format guidelines.

## What services will zig.day provide me?

When a Zig Day is listed on zig.day the organizers will be able to independently
customize their event profile page and create new events.

Your Zig Day will have a dedicated calendar (iCal) and RSS feed that will get
updated whenever you create a new event. Additionally, users will be able to
subscribe for email updates and will receive an email for every event.

The event calendar also supports updating events in case of any last-minute
change (well, not literally last *minute*, calendar applications usually update at
best every few hours).

In the future zig.day might introduce native support for RSVPing to events.

## Am I allowed to collect attendees info externally from zig.day?

Yes, you are free to create chat groups and whatnot. Note that we will **not**
share with you email addresses of users who sign up for email updates on zig.day.

You are also free to use any RSVP service you like, although you should be
mindful of minimizing the number of services you require your attendees to sign
up for.

## Am I allowed to collect money from attendees?

Yes, you are allowed, as long as the amount you ask is balanced in relation to
expenses to run the event. It's entirely up to you to setup money collection in
a way that is in compliance of your fiscal obligations.
